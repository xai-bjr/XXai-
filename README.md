# Crypto Price Alert - Starter Script

This repo contains a single-file Python tool `crypto_price_alert.py` that polls CoinGecko for crypto prices and sends email alerts when user-defined thresholds are crossed.

---

## What it does
- Polls CoinGecko simple price API for specified coin IDs (e.g., `bitcoin`, `ethereum`).
- Logs prices to CSV with UTC timestamps.
- Sends aggregated email alerts when thresholds are crossed (supports `below` and `above` thresholds).
- Runs on any system with Python 3.8+ — lightweight, portable, and simple to deploy.

## Why this tool?
Most people don’t have the time (or nerves) to refresh charts every 5 minutes.  
This script solves **“price anxiety”** by automatically monitoring the market for you.  
Whether you’re a day trader or a long-term investor, it ensures you’ll **never miss big moves**.

Instead of being glued to your phone or laptop, you can relax and let the script do the boring work of watching charts. It will only disturb you when something important happens — like a major dip or breakout. That means **less stress, fewer missed opportunities, and more peace of mind**.

About Me

Hey there 👋 I’m XXai®, a web developer with a passion for automation, clean code, and building tools that actually make life easier.

I’ve always believed programming is more than just typing code — it’s about solving real problems and saving people time. That’s why I enjoy working on projects like this crypto alert system: small, powerful, and practical.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring new tech trends, reading about finance, or experimenting with side projects. I enjoy blending traditional knowledge (the way things have always been done) with forward-thinking ideas (new tools, modern stacks, and creative solutions).

💻 Skilled in Python, JavaScript, and web frameworks.

🚀 Currently building automation tools & scripts for traders and everyday users.

🌍 Open to collaborations, freelance gigs, and interesting challenges.

✅ Key fixes I made:  
- Added **blank lines between headings**.  
- Closed all **code blocks** with triple backticks.  
- Replaced en dashes (`–`) with proper hyphens (`-`) for CLI flags.  
- Added proper Markdown formatting for **bold, italics, and lists**.  

If you **replace your current README with this version**, it will look exactly like a professional GitHub README on your `xai-bjr.github.io/XXai-` site.  

If you want, I can also make a **version with GIF/demo screenshots embedded** so your GitHub Pages site looks visually like a product page.  

Do you want me to do that next?
